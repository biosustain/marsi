**marsi** is an open-source software to created to identify non-GMO strain design targets.

There are two main experimental scenarios:

1. Adaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE)
2. Classic Strain Improvement (CSI)

CSI
===

In this scenario we assume that metabolizing the target compound is going to kill the cells. Using chemical
mutagenesis, the surviving cells have found a way around the metabolism and are capable of resuming their activity
without the reactions related with that metabolite.

Here the search can be performed using existing methods (such as OptGene[1] or OptKnock[2]) that can predict knockout
targets. The targets will be then replaced and tested for the presence of an analog. We also implemented OptMet, a new
method that uses Heuristic Optimization to search for metabolite targets directly.


ALE
===

The ALE scenario assumes a long term exposition and adaptation of the cells to an analog metabolite. Here we account for
essential and non-essential metabolites. For essential metabolites the cells will produce more of the target metabolite
so it can compete with the analog for the enzymes. For non-essential metabolites we assume reduced activity/specificity
towards the target metabolite and the activity will be inhibited. To identify wich pathways should be inhibited we use
DifferentialFVA[3].
